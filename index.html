            <p>Hi, I'm Jennifer Dang. I'm currently a Component Analyst. A few things about what I do is that I ensure different electronic components' quality and reliability through different testings such as chemical decapsulation, x-ray, scanning electron microscope, etc. I'm familiar with different military standards such as MIL-STD-883, MIL-STD-750, and MIL-STD-1580. I wanted to further my career with coding to get more familiar with both software and hardware development. </p>
